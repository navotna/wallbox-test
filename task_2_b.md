# Task
How would you test that the API between
the embedded and the mobile is working as
expected without having the real physical device
# Answer
The answer is quite similar to the [task_2_a](task_2_a.md). We don't have device -> emulate it.
Even if we don't have mobile phone, we can run mobile application in simulator and test API
